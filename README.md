# `🗣` ANONYMOUS DAT CHAT
---
## `📑` SUMMARY
- The anonymous dat chat aims to build a community where anonymity is secured. Think of it as a messenger from back in the day, such as MSN or AOL. It gives one the ability to customize their name and maintain anonymity whilst chatting with others.
---
## `⚙` INSTALLATION
- Installation for the Anonymous Dat Chat is simple and easy. Simply assign <a href="dat://datchat.hashbase.io/" target="blank">this url</a> to a button, div or header and it will redirect you to the chat. (Edit: The Beaker Browser is no longer functional and as such this project cannot be used).
